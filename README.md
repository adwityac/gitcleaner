# GitCleaner

A powerful command-line tool to find and clean junk files and folders from your development projects. Keep your repositories clean and save disk space!

## Features

- üîç **Smart Scanning**: Automatically detects common junk files and folders
- üßπ **Safe Cleaning**: Carefully removes unwanted files with confirmation
- üìä **Size Reporting**: Shows file sizes and total space usage
- üîß **Configurable**: Customize patterns with `.gitcleaner.json`
- üöÄ **Dry Run**: Preview what will be deleted before actual deletion
- ‚ö° **Fast**: Uses efficient glob patterns for quick scanning

## Installation

Install globally via npm:

```bash
npm install -g gitcleaner
```

Or run directly with npx:

```bash
npx gitcleaner scan
```

## Usage

### Scan for junk files

```bash
gitcleaner scan
```

This will show you all the junk files and folders found in your current directory and subdirectories.

### Clean junk files

```bash
gitcleaner clean
```

This will delete all detected junk files and folders.

### Dry run (preview only)

```bash
gitcleaner clean --dry-run
```

This will show you what would be deleted without actually deleting anything.

## Default Patterns

GitCleaner looks for these common junk patterns by default:

- `node_modules` - Node.js dependencies
- `dist` - Build output directories
- `build` - Build output directories
- `.DS_Store` - macOS system files
- `__pycache__` - Python cache directories
- `*.log` - Log files
- `coverage` - Test coverage reports
- `.nyc_output` - NYC coverage tool output
- `*.tmp` - Temporary files
- `*.temp` - Temporary files
- `.cache` - Cache directories
- `tmp` - Temporary directories

## Custom Configuration

Create a `.gitcleaner.json` file in your project root to customize the patterns:

```json
{
  "patterns": [
    "node_modules",
    "dist",
    "build",
    ".DS_Store",
    "*.log",
    "custom-folder",
    "*.custom"
  ]
}
```

## Example Output

### Scan Command

```bash
$ gitcleaner scan

üîç Scanning for junk files...

Found junk:
- node_modules/ (550 MB)
- dist/ (12 MB)
- coverage/ (8.5 MB)
- .DS_Store (4 KB)
- app.log (2 KB)

Total: 570.5 MB

üí° Run 'gitcleaner clean' to delete these files
```

### Clean Command

```bash
$ gitcleaner clean

üßπ Cleaning junk files...

- Deleted: node_modules/ (550 MB)
- Deleted: dist/ (12 MB)
- Deleted: coverage/ (8.5 MB)
- Deleted: .DS_Store (4 KB)
- Deleted: app.log (2 KB)

‚úÖ Cleaned 5 items (570.5 MB freed)
```

### Dry Run

```bash
$ gitcleaner clean --dry-run

üîç Would delete junk files...

- Would delete: node_modules/ (550 MB)
- Would delete: dist/ (12 MB)
- Would delete: coverage/ (8.5 MB)
- Would delete: .DS_Store (4 KB)
- Would delete: app.log (2 KB)

üìã Would clean 5 items (570.5 MB would free)
```
